 # description
 Tic-tac-toe is a terminnal based game for one or two players who take turns marking the spaces in a four-by-four grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
